Prisoner #J19-AA, for the crime of stealing candy from a baby,
you have been sentenced to death by a rhyme that -oddly enough-
went through a racist phase. However, there is a chance that you
may live this game of death. Your father and I were old drinking
buddies so I am going to give you some help. I have turned your
bed into a sleepotron-techno-hallucinawhatsit. All you have to do
is sleep for the night and let the machine do the thinking for you.

Good luck.
